# Chess
Minor Project: Chess With AI (7th Semester)

Language: Java

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

Basically, we are planning to make 1P vs 1CPU chess game. 

CPU will be using the very famous *Minimax algorithm* to calculate the possible moves from a particular position and *alpha-beta pruning* to eliminate traversing the trees whose alpha-beta values are not favourable till 2 levels.

Additionally, we plan to 

1. show moves log

2. undo moves

3. save games

4. load any game stored in portable game notation(PGN) format


Chess graphics are used from *chess.com*
